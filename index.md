Bio
---------

I am fourth-year BME PhD student in a small but lovely university Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/)), US, where I feel blessed to be advised by [Dr. Ge Wang](https://biotech.rpi.edu/centers/bic/people/faculty/ge-wang). Prior to RPI, I studied my undergraduate at [Harbin Institute of Tachnology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), China. 

I am interested in deep learning, fuzzy logic, applied math, and medical imaging. Recently, my research focuses on developing advanced deep learning models and their interpretation. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach me out (hitfanfenglei@gmail.com).
